This folder focuses on combat for the most part and several elements that deal with combat.

At first this was the simple attack, turn change, attack, repeat until win condition.
But now, while still woefully incomplete, it is far more than it was.

There is now an announcer, a Class built that is intended to view scenarios and announce a random statement based on this.
Originally this was one giant combat file, with spells and weapons, and death checks. Quickly that split into two separate files, one to house combat and one to house combat functions. Versatility and expanded spellcasting was added. An action economy has begun to be added. A big inclusion was monsters, who are for the most part implemented correctly, not nearly all monsters... more like.... appendix A from the original 5e monster manual, adapted to monsters from 2024.
As far as spellcasting goes, only cantrips were added for the moment.

I am encroaching upon the limits of... terminal interfacing with this so the next update will be regarding a visible map; as well as attempting to clean up some of the larger code blocks.

Overall this code has gone from a simple character generator to a character-sheet maker to something involving combat, and it is inching towards being similar to other virtual tabletops.
